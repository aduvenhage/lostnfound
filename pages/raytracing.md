# Raytracing Basics

## A Good Start
When I started googling 'raytracing', I came across Scratchapixel's Introduction to Raytracing (https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/how-does-it-work).  This helped me get started pretty quickly: Went from diffuse spheres to shiny metal spheres and from there to glass spheres -- very cool; quickly started with planes and patterns on them.

After that I discovered the 'Raytracing in One Weekend' series (https://raytracing.github.io/), which quickly helped me get to grips with the monte-carlo style of raytracing: Replaced light rays with, well, just more rays and got soft shadows for free; then added anti-aliasing, camera focus blur and lots more fun stuff.
